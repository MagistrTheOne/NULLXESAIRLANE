## NULLXES AIRLANE

**NULLXES AIRLANE** is a premium black-glass universe airline interface – a bold side project under the main **NULLXES** corporation.

- **Mission**: WE FLIGHT EVERYONE – from planets to void, beyond classic routes.  
- **Tone**: Corporate villain luxury — dark, silent, decisive, built for people who own their sky.  
- **Location**: Universe, all known and unknown layers.  
- **Creator**: MagistrTheOne, for the NULLXES family and close circle.

This repository, **NULLXESAIRLANE**, is our second flagship project: a public-facing, cinematic experience that reflects the internal standards, aesthetics, and ambition of the NULLXES corporation.
